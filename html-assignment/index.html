            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p>As it says above, my name is <em>Sean Goatcher</em>. I am an 18 year old who spends most of their free time playing video games, watching youtube videos, and going outside to experiment with my camera. I live in Ottawa, (although that's a given since I'm attending this college) and I was born in 2006 on May 9<sup>th</sup>. </p>

            <p>I also greatly enjoy reading manga (Japanese comics) and watching anime from time to time. My favourite mangas are <abbr title="Jujutsu Kaisen">JJK</abbr>, <abbr title="Dragon Ball">DB</abbr>, and <abbr title="One Piece">OP</abbr>. My favourite games are Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring. I like these games because they are highly difficult, but also very fair and rewarding.</p>
